  <h1>mm.StaffSVGVisualizer advanced usage</h1>
  <p>
    mm.StaffSVGVisualizer extends the basic mm.BaseVisualizer class with new capabilities 
    to draw music notes in one single staff per instance, which can be configured though 
    extended interface mm.StaffSVGVisualizerConfig. Those new capabilities include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Automatic Clef detection</b> will be done according to the average note, being it 
        F clef if it is under middle C and G clef in any other case. Once the clef has been 
        set, it will remain unchanged, no matter how the score will evolve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Displaying the score in a <b>compact visualization</b> way, just like paper printed 
        scores, which is the default behaviour and can be forced by setting 
        config.pixelsPerTimeStep to zero. Otherwise <b>proportional visualization</b> mode 
        will be used like in mm.PianoRollSVGVisualizer, where notes are separated according 
        with their duration from pixel 0 at leftmost side. In order to get staff context 
        information, proportional visualization makes music signatures blink sometimes to 
        show hidden musical symbols. You will notice in proportional visualization bar lines 
        are pretty close to first bar note, because there is where bar begins. In this mode 
        you should increase the config.pixelsPerTimeStep properly to avoid note overlapping 
        in very fast scores (16th notes or faster), though you can always enjoy automatic 
        padding space on notes and bars in compact visualization mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Default Key declaration</b> to adapt the score to the right accidentals in case 
        key is not stated for time 0 on the NoteSequence (otherwise, NoteSequence initial 
        value will overwrite it).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Instrument Filtering</b> to draw a subset of the NoteSequence tracks in one single 
        score. No filter will draw all tracks altogether in one score.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow scoreplaying with two added auto-scroll modes, besides default pagination  
        (<b>ScrollType.PAGE</b> or void), like centering active note on the middle of the 
        score in a note by note basis (<b>ScrollType.NOTE</b>) or centering it in bar sized 
        packed chunks (<b>ScrollType.BAR</b>) every time activeNote is the first one of a
        bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple <b>key signature</b> and <b>time signature</b> are supported (but notice 
        mm.urlToNoteSequence does not translate them from MIDI files yet).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h2>Mixing it all</h2>
    In next example you can relize several combined features. Two tracks of a single score have 
    been filtered in two staffs (left and right hand) which automatically adapt to the appropriate
    clef according to their note range. Switching Compact visualization mode makes same score be 
    drawn on different mm.StaffSVGVisualizer instances, from compact mode (like a printed staff), 
    to proportional mode (placing note heads in x axis similarly to piano-roll rectangles, ideal 
    for multiple piled up visualizers). Musical symbols have been scaled up according with the 
    defined 'noteHeight' config value. Visualization mode can be changed during playing, but 
    given there will be a new instance you can experience a fast rewind before scrolling to the 
    next active note. Finally G Key has been forced as default key assuming provided score doesn't 
    handle any key information.

    <h2>Multiple Key and Time signatures</h2>
    Next example adds more notes to the score (+) changing through all keys and the time signatures
    subset [2/4, 3/4, 4/4] to see how the staff grows and adapts to it. Please notice  mm.Player 
    does not handle incremental NoteSequence modifications once it has started to play.

    <h2>Piling several visualizers</h2>
    Next example loads a MIDI file and will split it in as many staffs as as tracks (instruments)
    it contains. Following, it will add a mm.PianoRollSVGVisualizer that will show a synchronized
    version of full score.

    <h2>Musical symbol catalog and managed use cases</h2>
    Next score shows all musical symbols (but F clef, previously shown). In a G clef score, C key and 
    4/4 time signature, all notes (all F) and rests from whole to sixty-fourth are shown in first four 
    bars with gradually lowering intensity (MIDI velocity). Following use cases are: a splitted note 
    between two bars (thirty-second tied to sixty-fourth), rest completion by a sequence of lowering 
    rests (half to sisty-fourth), polyphonic overlapping notes splitted and tied, bar splitted rests, 
    accidentals repetition avoiding (F#), accidental re-activation (normal F), accidental re-activation 
    (F#), accidental reset after bar (F#), accidental reset avoiding on tied notes after bar, accidental
    reset following tied notes after bar and, finally, dotted note. Time changes have been shown in 
    previous scores.
    <br>
    <br>
    Known issues are: No note beams are shown (flagged notes are used instead), and no triplets nor 
    quintuplets are managed yet.
