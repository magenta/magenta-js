  <h1>Visualizers</h1>
  <p>
    There are several MIDI or <code>NoteSequence</code> visualizers available.
    You can connect it to an <code>mm.Player</code> to update the visualization
    in sync with the audio.

    <h2>mm.StaffSVGVisualizer advanced usage</h2>
    <p>
      mm.StaffSVGVisualizer extends the basic configuration capabilities to add:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Displaying the score in a <b>compact visualization</b> way, just like paper printed 
          scores, by setting config.pixelsPerTimeStep to zero. Otherwise <b>proportional 
          visualization</b> mode will be used like in mm.PianoRollSVGVisualizer, where notes 
          are separated according with their duration from pixel 0 at leftmost side. In order
          to get staff context information, proportional visualization makes music signatures 
          blink sometimes to show hidden musical symbols. You will notice bar lines are pretty
          close to first bar note, because there is where bar begins. You can enjoy padding bars 
          in compact visualization mode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Automatic Clef detection</b> will be done according to the average note, being it 
          F clef if it is under middle C and G clef in any other case. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Default Key declaration</b> to adapt the score to the right accidentals in case 
          key is not stated for time 0 on the NoteSequence (otherwise, NoteSequence will 
          overwrite it).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Instrument Filtering</b> to draw a subset of the NoteSequence tracks in one single 
          score. No filter will draw all tracks altogether in one score.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow scoreplaying with two added auto-scroll modes, besides default pagination  
          (<b>ScrollType.PAGE</b> or void), like centering active note on the middle of the 
          score in a note by note basis (<b>ScrollType.NOTE</b>) or centering it in bar sized 
          packed chunks (<b>ScrollType.BAR</b>) every time activeNote is the first one of a
          bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiple <b>key signature</b> and <b>time signature</b> are supported (but notice 
          mm.urlToNoteSequence does not translate them from MIDI files yet).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Mixing it all
    </h3>
    In next example you can relize several combined features. Two tracks of a single score have 
    been filtered in two staffs (left and right hand) which automatically adapt to the appropriate
    clef according to their note range. Switching Compact visualization mode makes same score be 
    drawn on different mm.StaffSVGVisualizer instances, from compact mode (like a printed staff), 
    to proportional mode (placing note heads in x axis similarly to piano-roll rectangles, ideal 
    for multiple piled up visualizers). Musical symbols have been scaled up according with the 
    defined 'noteHeight' config value. Visualization mode can be changed during playing, but 
    given there will be a new instance you can experience a fast rewind before scrolling to the 
    next active note. Finally G Key has been forced as default key given provided score doesn't 
    handle any key information.

    <h3>Multiple Key and Time signatures</h3>
    Next example adds more notes to the score (+) changing through all keys and the time signatures
    subset [2/4, 3/4, 4/4] to see how the staff grows and adapts to it. Please notice  mm.Player 
    does not handle incremental NoteSequence modifications once it has started to play.

    <h3>Musical symbol catalog and managed use cases</h3>
    Next score shows all musical symbols (but F clef). In a G clef score, C key and 4/4 time signature, 
    all notes (all F) and rests from whole to sixty-fourth are shown in first four bars. Following use 
    cases are: a splitted note between two bars (thirty-second tied to sixty-fourth), rest completion 
    by a sequence of lowering rests (half to sisty-fourth), polyphonic overlapping notes splitted and 
    tied, bar splitted rests, accidentals repetition avoiding (F#), accidental re-activation (normal F), 
    accidental re-activation (F#), accidental reset after bar (F#), and dotted note. F clef, Key and 
    time changes have been shown in previous scores.
    <br>
    <br>
    Known issues are: No note beams are shown (flagged notes are used instead), and no triplets nor 
    quintuplets are managed yet.
