# MagentaMusic.js API

This JavaScript implementation of Magenta's musical note-based models uses [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) for GPU-accelerated inference.

We have made an effort to port our most useful models, but please file an issue if you think something is
missing, or feel free to submit a Pull Request!

For the Python TensorFlow implementations, see the [main Magenta repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta).

## Example Applications
Here are a few applications built with MagentaMusic.js:

* [Beat Blender](https://g.co/beatblender) by [Google Creative Lab](https://github.com/googlecreativelab)
* [Melody Mixer](https://g.co/melodymixer) by [Google Creative Lab](https://github.com/googlecreativelab)
* [Latent Loops](https://goo.gl/magenta/latent-loops) by [Google Pie Shop](https://github.com/teampieshop)
* [Neural Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/teropa/pen/RMGxOQ) by [Tero Parviainen](https://github.com/teropa)

## Available Models
### MusicRNN
[MusicRNN](./music_rnn) implements Magenta's LSTM-based language models. These include [MelodyRNN][melody-rnn], [DrumsRNN][drums-rnn], [ImprovRNN][improv-rnn], and [PerformanceRNN][performance-rnn].

### MusicVAE
[MusicVAE](./music_vae) implements several configurations of Magenta's variational autoencoder model called [MusicVAE][music-vae] including melody and drum "loop" models, 4- and 16-bar "trio" models, and chord-conditioned "multi-track" models.

## Getting started

There are two main ways to get MagentaMusic.js in your JavaScript project:
via [script tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_JavaScript_within_a_webpage) **or** by installing it from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
and using a build tool like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

### via Script Tag

Add the following code to an HTML file:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Load MagentaMusic.js -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magenta/music@0.0.5"> </script>

    <!-- Place your code in the script tag below. You can also use an external .js file -->
    <script>
      // Notice there is no 'import' statement. 'mm' is available on the index-page
      // because of the script tag above.
      const model = new mm.MusicVAE(
          'http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/' +
          'drums_2bar_hikl_small');
      const player = new mm.Player();

      model.initialize()
          .then(() => model.sample(1))
          .then((samples) => player.start(samples[0]));
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open up that html file in your browser and the code should run. After a few seconds you'll
hear a drum beat that was randomly generated by MusicVAE!

See *TODO(adarob, teropa): INSERT DEMO LINK* for a complete example application with code.

### via NPM

Add [MagentaMusic.js][mm-npm] to your project using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) **or** [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm).
For example, with yarn you can simply call `yarn add @magenta/music`.

Then, you can use the library in your own code as in the folliwng example:

```js
import * as mm from '@magenta/music';

const model = new mm.MusicVAE('/path/to/checkpoint');
const player = new mm.Player();

model.initialize()
    .then(() => model.sample(1))
    .then((samples) => player.start(samples[0]));
```

See our [demos](./demos) for example usage.

#### Example Commands

`yarn install` to install dependencies.

`yarn test` to run tests.

`yarn bundle` to produce a bundled version in `dist/`.

`yarn run-demos` to build and run the demo.

## Pre-trained Checkpoints
Since MagentaMusic.js does not support training models, you must use weights from a model trained with the Python-based [Magenta models][magenta-models]. We are also making available our own hosted pre-trained checkpoints.

### Magenta-Hosted Checkpoints
Several pre-trained MusicRNN and MusicVAE checkpoints are hosted on GCS. You can access a JSON index available checkpoints at https://goo.gl/magenta/js-checkpoints.

The JSON is formatted as a list of entries with the the following interface:

```ts
interface Checkpoint {
  id: string;  // A unique id for this checkpoint.
  model: 'MusicRNN'|'MusicVAE';  // The model class.
  description: string;  // A short human-readable description of the trained model.
  url: string;  // Path to the checkpoint directory.
}
```

While we do not plan to remove any of the current checkpoints, we will be adding more in the future.

If your application has a high QPS, you must mirror these files on your own server.

### Your Own Checkpoints

#### Dumping Your Weights
To use your own checkpoints with one of our models, you must first convert the weights to the appropriate format using the provided [checkpoint_converter](../scripts/checkpoint_converter.py) script.

This tool is dependent on [tfjs-converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter), which you must first install using `pip install tensorflowjs`. Once installed, you can execute the script as follows:

```bash
../scripts/checkpoint_converter.py /path/to/model.ckpt /path/to/output_dir
```

There are additonal flags available to reduce the size of the output by removing unused (training) variables or using weight quantization. Call `../scripts/checkpoint_converter.py -h` to list the avilable options.

#### Specifying the Model Configuration

TODO(iansimon): This will be dependent on how we end up setting up the model instantiation and config.
