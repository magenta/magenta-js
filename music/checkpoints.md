ID|Model|Description|URL
drums_2bar_lokl_small|MusicVAE|A 2-bar, 9-class onehot drum model with a strong prior (low KL divergence), which is better for sampling. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_lokl_small
drums_2bar_hikl_small|MusicVAE|A 2-bar, 9-class onehot drum model with a weak prior (higher KL divergence), which is better for reconstructions and interpolations. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_2bar_hikl_small
drums_2bar_nade_9|MusicVAE|A 2-bar, 9-class multilabel drum model with a NADE decoder.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_2bar_nade_9
mel_2bar_small|MusicVAE|A 2-bar, 90-class onehot melody model. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/mel_2bar_small
mel_16bar_small|MusicVAE|A 16-bar, 90-class onehot melody model with a 16-step conductor level. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/mel_16bar_small
trio_4bar_small|MusicVAE|A 4-bar, 'trio' model for melody, bass, and drums, with a 4-step conductor level. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model.|https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/trio_4bar_small
