ID | Model | Description | URL
drums_2bar_lokl_small | MusicVAE | A 2-bar, 9-class onehot drum model with a strong prior (low KL divergence), which is better for sampling. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_lokl_small
drums_2bar_hikl_small | MusicVAE | A 2-bar, 9-class onehot drum model with a weak prior (higher KL divergence), which is better for reconstructions and interpolations. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_2bar_hikl_small
drums_2bar_nade_9 | MusicVAE | A 2-bar, 9-class multilabel drum model with a NADE decoder. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/drums_2bar_nade_9
mel_2bar_small | MusicVAE | A 2-bar, 90-class onehot melody model. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/mel_2bar_small
mel_16bar_small | MusicVAE | A 16-bar, 90-class onehot melody model with a 16-step conductor level. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/mel_16bar_small
trio_4bar_small | MusicVAE | A 4-bar, 'trio' model for melody, bass, and drums, with a 4-step conductor level. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_vae/trio_4bar_small
basic_rnn | MusicRNN | A 36-class onehot MelodyRNN model. Converted from http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/models/basic_rnn.mag. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_rnn/basic_rnn
drum_kit_rnn | MusicRNN | A 9-class onehot DrumsRNN model. Converted from http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/models/drum_kit_rnn.mag. | https://storage.googleapis.com/download.magenta.tensorflow.org/tfjs_checkpoints/music_rnn/drum_kit_rnn
chord_pitches_improv | MusicRNN | A 36-class onehot melody ImprovRNN model conditioned on chords as described at https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/improv_rnn#chord-pitches-improv.
