**Magenta.js** is a collection of TypeScript libraries for doing inference with pre-trained Magenta models.
All libraries are published as [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40magenta).

Complete documentation is available at: https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js

More information and example applications can be found at [g.co/magenta/js](https://g.co/magenta/js).
